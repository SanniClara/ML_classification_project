# ML_classification_project (Wine quality) 
A guideline on how to predict with Machine Learning using TensorFlow and Keras. Dataset used in this example is a wine-quality dataset from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality


## Set Up

If your goal is to apply a classification/pattern recognition to your data, this is the place to look for :) What you need to run TensorFlow code in Python is either a cloud or a local environment that has access to a CPU. If you want to run the code on the web, you could use Google Colab, if you want to run your code locally with your own CPU, it is recommended to install Jupyter Notebook --> in this case I recommend to install Anaconda Navigation first and watch some tutorials on how to set up a Tensorflow environment via Anaconda. This will be super helpful for many other projects. Anaconda also provides a Python interpreter and many other environments and useful features ;)

## Data

You can use the prepared data i uploaded in this Repository in the same folder as the Code. There you also find the test.csv and evaluation_ds.csv data that was extraced from the original dataset to make predictions. You could also  look up wine ingredients on the internet and see if you find a new wine with the data features need and then use this wine to feed it in the model. :D 

Under the following url you can find the original data source:

## TensorFlow Code
I have uploaded two basically equal models, one is for predicting wine-Type (red- or white-wine) and the other code is for predicting the wine-quality.
